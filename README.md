Will display popup in frontend once tasks has completed in background thread


I am trying here to send a signal from background thread to front end which is basically a text message
which will confirm that process completed.
This is a very simple example

I am using Server Sent Event.
I am subscribing event at page load, that event will be generated by a background thread.
Background thread will wait for object would be having some value, I have added one notEmpty field 
in the object, once it is notEmpty fields value is true then bg(background thread) will start 
to process and will return result and then front end will generate popup.
